# Extract Wordpress posts to PDF 

Given a wordpress DB, where the tables are coded with a prefix of choice, 
this program extracts all posts of a certain type (target is ideapush plugin posts), 
augmenting the records with the list of boards and tags and even with the language detection using langdetect, 
with the purpose of outputting all to a PDF document (report).
